1. Write an SQL query to find the total revenue per product for the last quarter
query:
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, SUM(p.Price*s.Quantity) AS TotalRevenue
FROM products AS p INNER JOIN sales AS s
ON p.ProductID = s.ProductID
WHERE QUARTER(s.SaleDate) = QUARTER(CURDATE()) - 1
GROUP BY p.ProductID
ORDER BY p.ProductID

2. Total sales by product category
query:
SELECT p.ProductID, p.ProductName, p.Price, SUM(s.Quantity) AS Sales
FROM products AS p INNER JOIN sales AS s
ON p.ProductID = s.ProductID
GROUP BY p.ProductName
ORDER BY p.ProductID

3.Trends of sales over the last year
query:
SELECT 
    YEAR(s.SaleDate) AS Year,
    MONTH(s.SaleDate) AS Month,
    SUM(s.Quantity*p.Price) AS TotalRevenue
FROM products AS p 
INNER JOIN sales AS s
ON p.ProductID = s.ProductID
WHERE 
    s.SaleDate >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(s.SaleDate), MONTH(s.SaleDate)
ORDER BY 
    YEAR(s.SaleDate), MONTH(s.SaleDate);


4. Top 10 customers by sales volume
query:
SELECT 
    c.CustomerName,
    SUM(s.Quantity) AS TotalSales
FROM 
    sales s
JOIN 
    customers c ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
GROUP BY 
    s.CustomerID, c.CustomerName
ORDER BY 
    TotalSales DESC
LIMIT 10;
